# Memory Puzzle
A memory puzzle Windows Presentation Forms App. I developed this mostly to get the hang of c# and windows apps.
Fun fact: I tried learning how to make this from book about making games in python.
And then I made it with windows presentation forms.
Why would I read a python book and try to apply to Windows Forms? (Not even unity! windows forms!)
* I didnt know what unity was. lolololol
* My ADHD thought following a python tutorial was too easy
* My anxiety thought not knowing windows forms made me a failure


C'est la vie.


IDK why i had gui code in switch statements tho.
